Ronin is going to HBTU for the first time . As Kanpur is strange city for him he asks a vendor for help , the vendor tells him the direction from his current location to his destination HBTU in the form of a string containing $N,S,E,W$ . 

You are given the coordinates of current location of Ronin $(x,y)$ and the string containing the path e.g. $(NWSEWSWEN)$.

N -> 1 unit towards North .

S  -> 1 unit towards South .

E  -> 1 unit towards East .

W -> 1 unit towards West .

Your task is to calculate the difference between distance and displacement of the path.

Where distance is the length of the path told by the vendor and distance is minimum possible distance b/w starting and ending point.    

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- First line of each test case contains two integers $(x,y)$ , the starting point.
- Second line of each test case contains a string  , the $path$. 

###Output:
For each test case, output in a single line answer the difference between distance and displacement.  

###Constraints 
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $2 \leq x,y \leq 1000$
- The maximum possible length of string is $100$.
- String only contains $E,W,N,S$ .
- Print the output up to $6$ digits of decimal. 

###Sample Input :
	1
	2 2
	EWNSNSNEWEE

###Sample Output :
	8.763932
	
###Explanation :

In the given test case x=2 y=2 and the path is EWNSNSNEWEE

From the paths we get the destination ( 4, 3 ).

Therefore the displacement = 2.236068 and the distance is 11 . 

Hence difference = 8.763932

###NOTE :
-  You have to print strictly  6 digits  after decimal ( not more or less ) and to not round off.
