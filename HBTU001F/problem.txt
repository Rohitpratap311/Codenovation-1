There is chaos in CODE-CITY, crime is everywhere and our superhero CHEF has to save the city.  The master-mind of these crimes is the gangsta named BUG. 

Inorder to defeat Mr.BUG , CHEF has to enter the gangsta's secret vault and destroy everything he owns. The vault is highly gaurded and can be opened only by a secret passcode.

CHEF has an Array of length $N$ and he has to pick all the $Ai (1<=i<=N)$ such that there is only one $Aj (1<=j<=N)$ which divides Ai. 

More Formally :- 

Find all the integers Ai (1<=i<=N) with the following property:

For every integer Aj (1<=j<=N) such that i ? j , Aj does not divide Ai.

The passcode is the sequence of these Integers arranged in $INCREASING$ order. 

Your task is to find this passcode. 

If there is no such $Ai$ , return $-1$.

###Constrains:
- $1<=N<=10^4$
- $1<=Ai<=10^6$

###Subtasks:
- Subtask 1: Value of N doesn't exceed 1000  (15-points)
- Subtask 2: No additional Constraints             (85-points)


###Input:
- First line contains an Integer N
- Second line contains N space seperated Integers describing the array A.

###Output:
- IF there is a Passcode :Print the count(c) of Integers in the passcode in FIRST LINE and Print c space seperated Integers in the SECOND LINE
- IF there is no passcode: Print -1

###Sample Input:
	6
	4 5 6 2 7 11

###Sample Output:
	4
	2 5 7 11

###Explanation:
- The Integers picked By CHEF are  5 2 7 ans 11. On arranging them in increasing order we have 2 5 7 11.
