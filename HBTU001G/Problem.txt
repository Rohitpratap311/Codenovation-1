You are given a very big integer and you have to perform the following operation EXACTLY once on the integer.

Operation is as follow:

 "Remove a non-empty substring of (consecutive) digits from the integer and close the gap between them".

It is allowed for resultant integer to contain leading zeros. If you removes all digits, the resultant integer is considered to be 0.

You need to calculate the sum of all possible resultant integer after performing the operation JUST ONCE. 

Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.


###Input:
The first and only line contains a single integer .

###Output:
In the only line print the required sum modulo 10 ^9 +7.

###Constraints:
1 <= N < 10^10^5 


###Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (10 points): 1 <= N <10^18
- Subtask 2 (20 points): 1 <= N< 10^100
- Subtask 3 (70 points): original constraint

###Sample Input1:
	107

###Sample Output1:
	42

###Sample Input2:
	100500100500

###Sample Output2:
	428101984

###Explanation:
- N=107

Sum of all possible numbers after only one operation 1+7+10+07+17 = 42

42 % (10^9+7) =42
