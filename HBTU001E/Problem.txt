There are n children with indices $1$ to $n$. The $i$th child has a bag which can hold $Ai$ candies. We have m packets of candies . The $ith$ packet contains $Bi$ candies. Now for each packet we start distributing candies to the children starting from index 1. When the $i$th child bag gets fully filled we continue distributing candies  to the $( i+1)$ th child until all the candies from the choosen packet gets finished or no more children are left.

For every packet of candies print the total number of children whose bag gets fully filled.

Answer for each packet is separate.
###Input:
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A1  , A2,…..,AN$.
- The third line contains $M$ space-separated integers $B1 , B2,……,BN$.

###Output:
- For each test case, print a single line containing $M$ integers ? the total number of children whose bag gets fully filled.

###Constraints:
- $1 = T = 1000$
- $1 = N ,M = 10^5$
- $1 = Ai  = 10^5$
- $1 = Bi  = 10^5$
- Sum of $ N$ or $M$ doesn’t exceed $10^5$ for all test cases.

###Subtasks:
- Subtask #1 $(30 points)$ : $N = 1000$ , $M =1000$.  

- Subtask #2 ($70 points)$ : Original Constraints.


###Sample Input:
	2
	4 4
	5 8 10 16
	2 6 13 40	
	2 3
	8 3
	12 7 100

###Sample Output:
	0 1 2 4
	2 0 2

###Explanation:
- Example case 1: 

For B1= 2 We can give 2 candies only to first child. So no child gets his bag fully filled.

For B2 = 6. We can give 5 candies to child 1 and then we are left with 1 candy which we will give to child 2. So only first child gets his bag fully filled.

For B3= 13   We can give 5 candies to child 1 and then we are left with 8 candy then we will give 8 candies to child 2 and then no candies are left. So two children gets their bag fully filled.

For B4= 40   We can give 5 candies to child 1 and then we are left with 35 candy then we will give 8 candies to child 2 and then we are left with 37 candies and then we will give 10 candies to child 3 and then we are left with 17 candies. At last we will give 16 candies to the last child So all children gets their bag fully filled.
