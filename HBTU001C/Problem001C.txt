Nihal goes to lottery shop and buys a ticket which has two sides . Three numbers $N$ , $p$ , and $q$ are printed on the front side of the ticket while there are four numbers $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ on the back side.

As Nihal is a great observer he finds a pattern to predict if he is getting a lucky ticket or not.

Every ticket has its value $X$ and if $X$ is even then then the ticket is $LUCKY$ otherwise $UNLUCKY$.

According to Nihal's pattern 

         X= (|a-d|+|b-c|) -p          if N is a gap number .

         X= (|a-d|+|b-c|) +q          if N is not a gap number .



A number is a $gap$ number if it has at least 3 digits and it is divisible by the number formed with its first and last digit .  

###Input:

The only line of input will have 7 numbers $N$ $p$ $q$ $a$ $b$ $c$ $d$ .
###Output:
Print a single line $LUCKY$ if the ticket is lucky  or $UNLUCKY$ if the ticket is unlucky.

###Constraints 
- $N \leq p \leq q \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$
- $N$ has at least three digits.  


###Sample Input 1:
	192 3 14 6 8 9 12
	

###Sample Output 1:
	LUCKY

###Sample Input 2:
	193 3 14 6 8 9 12

###Sample Output 2:
	UNLUCKY
	
###EXPLANATION:
- Test Case 1:
N=192  p=3  q=14  a=6  b=8  c=9  d=12

192 is a gap number because it is divisible by the number formed with its first and last digit $1$9$2$      192 % 12 = 0.

Therefore X= |6-12|+|8-9|-3 = 6 + 1 - 3 = 4 and 4 is even so the ticket is $LUCKY$.

- Test Case 2:
N=193  p=3  q=14  a=6  b=8  c=9  d=12

193 is a not a gap number it is divisible by the number formed with its first and last digit $1$9$2$      192 % 12 != 0.

Therefore X= |6-12|+|8-9|+14 = 6 + 1 +14 = 21 and 21 is not even so the ticket is $UNLUCKY$.
