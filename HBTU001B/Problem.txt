Aryan is a young boy who loves sports . One day his elder sister Ruhi decides to take her 
to sports ground. After sometime Aryan asks her sister to play the game Multiple Jumps.

Multiple Jumps is track field game in which a player has to reach the end point of a straight track by jumping only on Valid points and he/she must visit each Valid point .

But Aryan is a young boy and he can only Jump from point A to point B if distance b/w A and B is less than or equal to $X$.

Being a elder sister Ruhi decides to help Aryan in at most $P$ jumps if its has the distance greater than $X$.

Your task is to find if Aryan can complete the game with his sisters help or not.


###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains of a two line of input, in the first line three integers $N$ , number of points on the track $P$ , number of times Ruhi will help and  $X$.
- Second line of each test case contains $N$ integers , the x - coordinates of valid points. 

###Output:
For each test case, output in a single  $YES$, if Aryan will complete the game or $NO$ if does not.

###Constraints 
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $ 0 \leq P \leq 10^5$
- $ 1 \leq X \leq 10^5$
- $ 1\leq A[i] \leq 10^5$ 
- Aryan starts at 0 coordinate. 



###Sample Input:
	2
	4 1 4
	1 6 9 11
	4 0 4
	1 6 9 11
###Sample Output:
	$YES$
	$NO$
	
###EXPLANATION:
In the first case N=4 , P=1 , X=4

Aryan is at 0 coordinate and he has to make jumps of distance 1 , 5 , 3 , 2 respectively.

His limit is 4 so he can only take 3 valid jumps but will make a jump with Ruhi's help and will complete the game. 

In the second case N=4 , P=0 , X=4

Aryan is at 0 coordinate and he to make jumps of distance 1 , 5 , 3 , 2 respectively.

His limit is 4 so he can only take 3 valid jumps and P=0 so Ruhi will not help him for any jump. Therefore he can not complete the game .
